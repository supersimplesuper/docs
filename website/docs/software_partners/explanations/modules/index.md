# SuperAPI modules

Firstly, what is a SuperAPI module? Every time you create a SuperAPI onboarding session, a set of modules is defined along with it. These modules are the pages (or in some cases, multiple pages) that your employees move through when they use our software to onboard. We are constantly updating and adding modules and when integrated with SuperAPI, you get the benefit of using these modules with very little development effort required to implement them. Just pick the modules you want and listen to the data we return back to you from them.
