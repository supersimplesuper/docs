## FAQ: Help activating automated super stapling

### Unable to access ATO Access Manager?

If you receive an error when attempting to login to ATO Access Manager then you do not have the required authorisations. You can login to the [Resource Authorisation Manager (RAM)](https://authorisationmanager.gov.au/) to view your privileges. To login to ATO Access Manager you will require the role of "Principal Authority" or "Authorisation administrator". You will also require "Full" level of access to the "Australian Tax Office (ATO)".

### Don't have a MyGovID?

If you don't have a MyGovID, you also won't have access to ATO Access Manager (AM), or Resource Authorisation Manager (RAM). You should speak to the owner of the business, finance team or payroll team and determine who has a MyGovID, and access to these portals. Once you have determined who has access, provide these instructions for them to complete.
