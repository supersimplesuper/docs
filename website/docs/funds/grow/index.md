# Grow

This guide explains the Grow capability, which enables your fund to accept new members during an employer’s onboarding flow.

## About Grow

Grow enables a super fund to:

1. Open a new member account in real time when an employee selects your fund.
2. Return the new membership details to the employer so payroll contributions can commence immediately.
3. Capture verified personal data at source, reducing manual processing and follow‑up.

A successful implementation hinges on a member registration service that can accept a fully‑populated member file from SuperAPI and respond with the new account details.

## Integration paths

| Method                           | Who builds it | Key tasks                                                                                                           | Typical effort                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Member Registration API     | Super fund    | Expose HTTPS endpoint, implement auth, create member record in core system, send response.                          | Medium – ideal if fund has APIs. |

> Note: We do have other integration paths that are not listed here. Please contact us to discuss them.

## Data available for registration

The table below lists possible fields that SuperAPI can supply when creating a new membership. Your fund can decide which of these to accept or treat as optional, depending on your internal rules and product design.

| Field                    | Notes                                                                                                                                                           |

> Tip: Accepting as many of the higher‑quality identity fields as possible (for example TFN, date of birth, email and phone number) helps prevent duplicate memberships and reduces friction for both the member and your operations team.

## High‑Level flows

### API flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as 3rd party software
    participant S as SuperAPI
    participant F as Super fund

    P-->>S: Creates onboarding session
    S->>Employee: Collects personal data, shows fund choices
    Employee->>S: Selects Super Fund F (join)
    S-->>F: POST /v1/member_registration (full profile)
    F-->>S: New member_number + account_number
    S-->>P: Webhook with confirmed membership
```

#### Endpoint

```
POST /v1/member_registration
Content‑Type: application/json
```

##### Required headers

These are dependent on the auth flow that is agreed.

| Header           | Notes                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `X-Auth-Key` | Api key          |


##### Successful response

```json
{
  "member_details": {
    "member_number": "12345678",
  }
}
```

A member number is the minimum amount of data that we require to process the onboarding. You are welcome to return additional data which we can surface to the employee. 

##### Error handling

| Status        | When to use                         | Retry guidance                                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400`         | Malformed JSON or failed validation | No retry                                                    |
| `401` / `403` | Authentication failed               | No retry until credentials fixed                            |
| `429`         | Rate limit exceeded                 | Retry after `Retry‑After` seconds                           |
| `5xx`         | Temporary server issue              | SuperAPI will retry with exponential back‑off up to 3 times |

##### Security and compliance
* **Transport**: All traffic must use TLS 1.2+.
* **Authentication**: We support many authentication flows, our preference is JWT generated from pre-shared keys.

##### Versioning and change control
* The API is versioned via the URL, eg. `/v1/member_registration`.
* Backwards‑compatible changes are announced at least 30 days in advance.
* Breaking changes require 90 days notice.
