## Who we are - SuperAPI and Xonboard

SuperAPI is on a mission to simplify employer compliance through intuitive, integrated tools that automate payroll and superannuation obligations. We started with a simple idea: remove the friction from employee onboarding. Today, tens of thousands of Australians use our products every month, and we're building towards a future where every employer, payroll system, and super fund can connect seamlessly. With Payday Super reforms landing in 2026, the demand for trusted, compliant solutions like ours is growing rapidly.

Our product is an embeddable employee onboarding experience that can be dropped into any payroll provider, time and attendance software or HR system provider.  We work with some of the biggest payroll software organisations in Australia.  We also have our own customer-facing product, Xonboard, which is a solution built for Xero Payroll users. It helps employers, accountants, and bookkeepers easily collect tax, bank, and super details from new employees,  securely, compliantly, and ready for payroll. You can find us in the [Xero App Store](https://apps.xero.com/au/search/app/xonboard).

We're a small, hands-on team with big ambitions. We focus on building simple, secure products that help our customers succeed. We're looking for optimists with curiosity, dedication, and resilience to tackle problems and drive solutions.

## How we hire

At SuperAPI, we know people join startups not just for the role, but for the journey. We're still a small team, so every hire has a big impact on how we work, what we build, and how we grow. That's why our hiring process looks beyond skills alone, we care just as much about how you approach problems, work with others, and live our values.

### What we look for

We've noticed that the people who thrive here share some common values:

* **Optimism**: A belief things can be improved, and a constructive approach to challenges
* **Practical** innovation: You solve real problems with thoughtful, reliable solutions, not tech for tech's sake.
* **Curiosity**: A drive to learn new things and explore better ways of doing the work
* **Integrity** and trust: You do the right thing even when no one is watching. You take pride in your work, and build trust through everything you do
* **Collaboration**: Recognising that we achieve more when we work better together

## Our process

We usually start with a conversation that's less about your CV and more about who you are, how you work, and whether our values resonate with you. If we both feel it's a good fit, we'll move to a skills-based interview that reflects the real work you'd be doing here. For some roles that might mean pairing on code, for others it might be running through a customer scenario, a product case study, or presenting examples of work you've delivered before.

We don't do trick questions or artificial tests. Our goal is to give you a realistic view of what it's like to work at SuperAPI, and for us to understand how you'd approach the challenges and opportunities ahead.

## Engineering At SuperAPI

We run on an Elixir stack and love the clarity, reliability, and scalability it gives us. Our team cares deeply about clean, maintainable code and solving real problems with the right tools, not just the shiniest ones. Our hiring process reflects that mindset. You'll get to show us how you approach code, through practical exercises and conversations with our engineers, and we'll show you how we collaborate, review, and ship in production. We value thoughtful problem-solving, curiosity, and engineers who enjoy leaving the codebase better than they found it.
